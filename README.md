### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate front-end developer with commercial experience. Some of my tech stack is React, Next.js, Gatsby.js, Typescript, but I also started building decentralized apps using Ethers, useDapp, The Graph, IPFS, Hardhat and Solidity. Apart from coding I also build user interfaces using Figma or Adobe XD.
