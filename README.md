### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passion-driven, experienced, and ambitious front-end developer focused on building modern and intuitive user interfaces. I have expertise in taking full responsibility for implementing big features and working in a team to implement even bigger functionalities. I care a lot about the code that I write considering its maintainability in the future and my colleagues who may have to deal with it one day :-) I appreciate honest and thorough code reviews and do not have an issue accepting constructive criticism. I am open to discussing different approaches to a problem and reviewing its pros and cons to develop the best solution.
